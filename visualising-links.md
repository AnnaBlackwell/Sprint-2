What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?
Don’t do it

How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:

Brightness:
Unvisited links should be brighter, with higher saturation. Visited links would then look dull or ‘used’ in comparison.

Hue:
The two colours should be variants of the same colour to indicate that they are related. Blue and purple are commonly used to indicate unvisited and visited links respectively.

Visibility to color-blind users:
Reds and greens can be difficult for colour-blind people to distinguish. Red or green links must be underlined to communicate to these users that they are links.

What is a "perceived affordance"?
Perceived affordance: the qualities of an object that suggest how it can or should be used, i.e. does the user perceive that clicking on that object is a meaningful, and useful thing to do?)

When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
It is not necessary to underline links where there are lists of links, or in navigation bars (as long as it clearly looks like a navigation bar to the user).

Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
Blue shouldn’t be used for normal text because it suggests clickability. Because blue is very commonly used as a link colour, it is strongly associated with links for most people.

If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
To signal clickability of a link that is not underlined, make the link change visually when a user hovers over it (e.g. add an underline).

What are link titles and how might you use them?
Link titles are short explanations or previews of a link destination that may appear when a user hovers over the link, so that the user can predict where the link will take them.
Link titles might be used to indicate the link destination site or subsite, to indicate the type of information the user can expect to find, or to warn people of potential issues with the destination site (e.g. registration is required).
