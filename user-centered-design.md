Principles of user centred design notes:

1 Design for the users and their tasks
Consider life from the user’s perspective; what are their values, abilities, and priorities, and what environment are they operating in? Does the computer system solve their problems in an accessible and practical way?

2 Be consistent
It’s important to keep the interface consistent so users know what to expect of a system. Changing the behaviour of the interface elements can confuse and irritate people.

3 Use simple and natural dialogue
Keep text simple; give the user only what they need at the time. Avoid jargon and complicated language. Define terms if necessary.

4 Reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user
Make it easy for the user to do what they are doing. Allow them to focus on the task rather than be distracted trying to use the system. Simplify tasks and minimise opportunity for error.

5 Provide adequate feedback
Communicate the outcome of a user’s action back to the user. This may require a progress bar. Only provide the information that is necessary and relevant to the user at the time.

6 Provide adequate navigation mechanisms
Make it easy for a user to see where they are, where they have been, and how to navigate the system, by using clear titles, scroll bars, page numbers, navigation overview, etc.

7 Let the user drive
Let the user access the information they need to do their task in their preferred sequence, and make the process as simple as possible.

8 Present information clearly
Make it easy for the user to understand the information you are presenting, by using spacing and boxes for different items. Only provide as much information as is needed to perform the task.

9 Be helpful
Systems should be self-explanatory. Online help should be task-oriented, with simple steps to go through.

10 Reduce errors
Anticipate where opportunities for errors, and minimise or eliminate them where possible. Show error messages in plain language, to help the user fix the problem.

Comments:
The first rule, “design for the users and their tasks” is the most important from my point of view. I feel that the other 9 rules could be summarised by this one rule. I don't think any of these are unimportant.
