I used to be a bad invalidator. I remember one time in particular, my friend was having a difficult time, having just moved to London, unemployed and financially stressed, and trying to find employment in a city where she didn't have a support network. I wanted her to focus on the positives and find her way through, but I made the mistake of saying "it could be much worse, at least....". Since then I actually read a few of Brene Brown's books, and realised what I had done. I try to be a better, more empathetic listener now.
