I met up with Sam in person, to start trying to pair programming, and to catch up about how we are finding Phase 0 in general. We had planned to work on the Javascript exercises.

A few days prior, I had read through the Javascript tutorials and had a go at the code. I had learnt python previously, and found JS to be quite similar, so it wasn't too difficult. I 'accidentally' finished all of the tasks; it didn't take anywhere near the estimated 3 hours. So when I went to see Sam I had already finished it.

When I saw Sam, we decided to just talk through the problems and JS structures we needed to use. Sam mostly wrote his code separately, and we compared them.

It wasn't particularly productive in this instance, but I realise this is just a first attempt. I think pair programming would work better when doing a more substantial piece of work, but in any case, it was good to touch base with my class-mate.
