Reflections on Agile project management

My current role is a project manager in the health sector, and my training has been in traditional project management methodologies. 

In my projects, the timeline is constantly getting blown out, and scope-creep (or scope-splosion) happens all the time. The environment does not suit strict project management. More often than not, a project plan becomes a historical document, written once to get agreement, then thrown away when it becomes clear that the desired outcome is a moving target. 

Agile is a totally different way of looking at uncertainty and flexibility. I have read and heard about Agile and the Scrum framework, but I have no first hand experience, so this is pretty interesting.
